# eCLM atmospheric forcing generator

This repository shows how to generate atmospheric forcings for eCLM simulations.

For an overview of the needed atmospheric forcing variables for eCLM see [Overview atmospheric forcing files](overview-section).

For the default creation of atmospheric forcing based on ERA5 data see [eCLM atmospheric forcing based on ERA5](era5forcing).

For the default creation of atmospheric forcing based on SEAS5 data see [eCLM atmospheric forcing based on SEAS5](seas5forcing).
