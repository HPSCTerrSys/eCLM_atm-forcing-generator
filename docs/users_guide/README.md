# eCLM atmospheric forcing generator

This repository shows how to generate atmospheric forcings for eCLM simulations.

An overview of the needed atmospheric forcing variables for eCLM can be found [here](overview.md#overview-atmospheric-forcing-files).

The default is the creation of atmospheric forcing based on ERA5 data [here](era5-forcing.md#eclm-atmospheric-forcing-based-on-era5).
